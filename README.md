## 💼 Business Challenges

Cloud Mart faced numerous operational hurdles:

- ⚠️ High operational costs due to manual customer service workflows and inefficient backend systems  
- ⌛ Slow and risky release cycles caused by monolithic and tightly coupled legacy architecture  
- 📉 Scalability and availability issues resulting in frequent downtime during peak sales periods  
- 👩‍💼 Loss of key engineering talent unable to adapt to cloud-native and AI technologies  
- 🛠️ Fragmented tooling and siloed development processes causing inefficiencies and bottlenecks  
- 🤖 Pressure to rapidly innovate and automate workflows to keep pace with competitors like Klarna using AI-driven customer engagement  
- 🔐 Security gaps and compliance risks due to manual infrastructure management and inconsistent standards  

Cloud Mart needed a modern, cloud-native, AI-enabled platform that would accelerate deployment, scale reliably, and enhance customer and business insights.
