# Cloud Mart – AI-Driven Multi-Cloud E-Commerce Platform with DevOps Transformation



## 🔥 Project Overview

**CloudMart** is a modern e-commerce platform built from the ground up to support high scalability, intelligent customer support, and real-time analytics using DevOps and AI best practices. The goal was to **re-architect and migrate** a legacy monolithic system to a **multi-cloud, AI-powered, DevSecOps-enabled microservices architecture**.

> 📈 *This transformation reduced customer support costs by 90%, improved deployment velocity by 70%, and enabled data-driven decision-making through real-time analytics.*

## 💼 Business Problem, Solution & Impact

### 🧨 Business Problem

CloudMart was running on a legacy monolithic system supported by a large but outdated IT team and a manual customer support process. The key issues were:

- ❌ A 30-member IT team lacked expertise in **multi-cloud, DevOps, and AI**. Many were resistant to change.
- 💸 No available **budget** to invest in modernization using cloud-native and AI tools.
- 🧱 **Slow deployments**, inconsistent environments, and frequent **downtime** during peak sales periods.
- 👨‍💼 A **500-person customer support team** handled all queries manually, leading to high payroll costs.
- 📊 The company had **no data platform** to analyze sales or customer feedback in real time.

### 📌 Organizational Shift

- The **CTO laid off 80% (24 people)** from the IT team to reallocate budget.
- A new **8-person elite team** with modern DevOps, cloud, and AI skills was hired to lead the transformation.
- The objective: **Re-architect, automate, and modernize** CloudMart into an AI-enabled, multi-cloud commerce platform.

### ✅ Solution Implemented

- 🧱 Rebuilt the application into **microservices** using **Docker & Kubernetes (Amazon EKS)**.
- ⚙️ Used **Terraform** to provision infrastructure across AWS, Azure, and GCP with reusable modules.
- 🚀 Implemented **CI/CD pipelines** using GitHub Actions, AWS CodeBuild, and CodePipeline for rapid and safe deployments.
- 🤖 Integrated **AI assistants** (OpenAI & Amazon Bedrock) to automate 90% of customer support inquiries.
- 📊 Built a **real-time data pipeline** using DynamoDB Streams → AWS Lambda → **Google BigQuery** for sales analytics.
- 😃 Integrated **Azure AI Language** for **sentiment analysis** to track customer satisfaction with AI support in real time.
- 🔐 Enforced **DevSecOps practices**: IAM roles, IRSA, Trivy scans, and centralized secrets via Secrets Manager.
